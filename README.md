## Part 1: Imaging Technique Inspiration

**Glitch Art**

Glitch Art is an art form that simulates electronic display errors, also known as glitches, for aesthetic purposes. This effect often appears in technology-inspired visuals to express instability or distortion of dimensions. For instance, in the film 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse', it is used to depict characters from alternate universes appearing in a visually “incorrect” state (Figure 1). This imaging technique can add a strong sense of technology and sophistication to the visuals, as seen in the text transition in Figure 2.

This coding example demonstrates how to create a text glitch effect on a website using HTML and CSS, with interactive distortion triggered when the mouse hovers over the text.

This example is not directly related to the glitch effect but is intriguing—it uses programming to simulate the movement patterns of living organisms.
